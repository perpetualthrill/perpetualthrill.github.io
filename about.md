Using biofeedback, it is possible for an otherwise untrained person to vary their heart rate by five to
ten percent. The console the players will be standing at can detect a full-range ECG. Once a beat is
detected, a vibration motor and a pulsing light gives each player real-time feedback at the peak of
their own QRS complex. In front of them, sharing a stand with the flame effect, is a display that
shows both of their heart rates, and gives feedback when the rates begin to match. Thus, between the
biofeedback and the numeric feedback, the players will be able to match their heart rates and unlock
a sweet explosion.

The effect itself has two groups of heads, one roughly occupying the volume of the heart’s
ventricles, and the other occupying the aorta. The human heartbeat has two successive pulses, as the
aorta and ventricles fire in succession. The effect will use two accumulators and two solenoid
valves to replicate it, with computer controlled timing to create a believable set of four
**who-whomp** heartbeat explosions synchronized with the players’ BPM. Additionally, there will be a
sound system built into the console to accentuate the boom.

Our mission is to bring two people together, whether they’re out on a playa date, or new
friends, or complete strangers from the crowd. Within the game’s sixty second timeframe -- over a
couple of rounds, if the first one doesn’t work out -- this installation promises to do exactly
that.
