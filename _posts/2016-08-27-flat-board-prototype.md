title: Flat board sensor prototype
---

This is using the [Sparkfun AD8232](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12650) sensor board along with their Arduino clone.
It matches the commercial sensor I am testing with, but requires a lot of pressure. Of note, only three of the pads are connected,
and the right-leg drive is feeding into the right pinky area.
