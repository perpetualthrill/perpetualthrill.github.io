title: Block diagram of the console
---

Here is the final (?) circuit diagram for the console. It shows the isolator as well as
the motor and lamp outputs. The build will have two of these connected to the same
Raspberry Pi, which will be responsible for matching the BPM, showing the console output,
and triggering the flame effect.
