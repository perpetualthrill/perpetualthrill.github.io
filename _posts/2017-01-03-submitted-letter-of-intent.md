title: Letter of intent submitted to Black Rock City Honoraria program
---

It's the [first step of their grant process](http://burningman.org/culture/burning-man-arts/grants/brc-honoraria/submit_grant/)
and is due tomorrow. The submission required a brief overview of the design and intent of this project, nothing complicated
and all stuff I have thought though pretty well.

It also required an image, so I whipped this up in Sketchup. It's a pretty close approximation, though I didn't have time to
rebuild that anatomical heart as a steel latice, which is what the actual sculpture will look like. Also, Sketchup does not have
a lighting model -- given that As One is a nighttime-only experience, the full-bright rendering is not doing us any favors.
